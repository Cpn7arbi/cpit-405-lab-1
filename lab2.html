    <h1>Muhammed Ali Fights</h1>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Clay in 1942, was an American professional boxer and cultural icon, widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. Here are examples of his wins</p>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Fight Against Sonny Liston (1964) </h3>
    <p>Ali dominated the fight, and Liston didn't come out for the seventh round, making Ali the youngest heavyweight champion at the time.</p>
    
    <h3>"Rumble in the Jungle" vs. George Foreman (1974)</h3>
    <p>Ali faced the fearsome and undefeated George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire. Using his famous "rope-a-dope" strategy, Ali absorbed Foreman's powerful punches before launching a counterattack in the eighth round, knocking Foreman out and reclaiming the heavyweight title.</p>
    
    <h2>See also</h2>
    <p>Muhammad Ali was a devout Muslim, and his faith played a central role in his life and identity. Born Cassius Clay, he converted to Islam in 1964, shortly after winning his first heavyweight title. He changed his name to Muhammad Ali, rejecting what he called his "slave name" and embracing a new identity that reflected his religious beliefs.</p>
